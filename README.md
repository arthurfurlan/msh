# msh
msh is command line script used as wrapper to run "mosh" with "ssh" as a fallback... because life is too short to manually test both of them.

## Usage

Use msh as a drop-in replacement for ssh or mosh.

    $ msh user@foo.bar

## Installation

    $ cp msh.py /usr/local/bin/msh
    $ chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/msh
